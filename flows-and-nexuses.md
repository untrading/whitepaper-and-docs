# Flows and Nexuses

## The Flow System

Flows unite participants in a token’s value journey. Buying a token secures a place in a mathematical sequence ensuring rewards from future price growth. Sliding Windows allocate these rewards, distributing gains fairly among past and present owners. This eliminates traditional trading biases:

* **Prediction becomes irrelevant:** Success relies on participation, not foresight.
* **Fairness is built in:** Rewards align with contributions.
* **Emotional pitfalls are minimized:** Outcomes are guided by systems, not decisions.

For instance:

| Owner No. | Sell Price | Profit  | Future Rewards (35%) | Distribution Target    |
| --------- | ---------- | ------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1         | $100.00    | $100.00 | $35.00               | Themselves             |

| Table 1: Selling Prices and Rewards Contributed by Each User |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |

1. Owner #1 sells a token at $100, contributing 35% to Future Rewards.
2. Owner #2 buys at $100, sells at $121, and contributes a portion to the rewards pool.
3. Earlier participants share in these gains, incentivizing long-term engagement.

### Contribution and Rewards

When you buy an un-token, you join an exclusive mini-community of past and current owners known as the Flow. By participating in a high-growth, long-lasting asset, you contribute the same percentage of your profit to the Flow as everyone else. However, as the asset's price increases in the future after you sell it, you receive Future Rewards distributions that can significantly exceed your initial contribution—akin to buying a variable annuity. Visit the[ Extra Earnings Calculator](https://untrading.org/) to see how Future Rewards work in practice.&#x20;

## The Community Layer

Community expand beyond individual tokens to platform-wide collaboration. They enable decentralized governance and collective wealth creation, linking multiple Flows into unified, cooperative ecosystems. This structure amplifies collective success and fosters sustainability.

**Untrading Community Ranking System: Node to Nexus**\
This 5-tier progression uses futuristic, network-inspired names to symbolize growth from isolated participants to a vast, resilient ecosystem. Each level builds on the last, emphasizing collaboration, shared upside (via ERC-5173's future rewards), and Network State-like sovereignty.

## A Fair Framework

Untrading transforms markets by replacing zero-sum dynamics with collaborative value creation:

Traditional Equation:

```
P(A) + P(B) + F ≤ 0
```

Where:

* P(A): Profit of trader A
* P(B): Profit of trader B
* F: Transaction fees and friction costs

Untrading’s Equation:

```
P(A) + P(B) + F + FR > 0
```

Where:

* FR: Shared value creation through cooperative mechanisms

This framework, implemented through the ERC-5173 protocol, creates what we call Future Rewards—a systematic flow of benefits that:

* **Rewards long-term participation over short-term speculation**
* **Distributes value based on mathematical principles rather than trading skill**
* **Creates alignment between early and late participants**
* **Generates sustainable value through systematic cooperation**

### The Future of Finance

Untrading replaces competition with collaboration, offering a fair, sustainable financial system where participation generates rewards. Inspired by Lao Tzu’s wisdom—**"The wise man is one who knows what is unchanging and flows with the changing"**—Untrading builds a future of shared prosperity, redefining how markets operate.
