# 🔠 Terms of Service

## Welcome&#x20;

Welcome to https://app.untrading.org, a website-hosted user interface (the "**Interface**" or "**App**") provided by untrading.org (“**untrading.org**,” “**we**,” “**us**,” “**our**”). The Interface provides access to a decentralized protocol, subject to the following Terms of Service (as amended from time to time, the “**Terms**”), on various public blockchains, including but not limited to Ethereum, that allows users to trade certain compatible digital assets ("**the untrading protocol**" or the "**Protocol**"). The Interface is one, but not the exclusive, means of accessing the Protocol. To use the Interface, you must use non-custodial wallet software, which allows you to interact with public blockchains. Your relationship with that non-custodial wallet provider is governed by the applicable terms of service of that third party, not this Terms of Service Agreement (the "**Agreement**").&#x20;

By signing up for an account on the Interface or otherwise using or accessing the Protocol, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to these Terms. The Privacy Policy and all such additional terms, guidelines, and rules as set forth on the Protocol are hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms and expressly agreed to and acknowledged by the User.&#x20;

This Agreement explains the terms and conditions by which you may access and use the Interface. You must read this Agreement carefully. By accessing or using the Interface, you signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by this Agreement in its entirety. If you do not agree, you are not authorized to access or use the Interface and should not use the Interface.&#x20;

**NOTICE: PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY, AS THEY CONTAIN AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE AND OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, REMEDIES, AND OBLIGATIONS. THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE REQUIRES (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) THAT YOU SUBMIT CLAIMS YOU HAVE AGAINST US TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION, AND FURTHER (1) YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO PURSUE CLAIMS AGAINST UNTRADING.ORG ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING, (2) YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO SEEK RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND (3) YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS YOU HAVE AGAINST US RESOLVED BY A JURY OR IN A COURT OF LAW.**&#x20;

untrading.org is not a wallet provider, exchange, broker, financial institution, money services business, or creditor. untrading.org provides a peer-to-peer web3 service that helps users discover and directly interact with each other and unNFTs available on public blockchains. We do not have custody or control over the NFTs or blockchains you are interacting with and we do not execute or effectuate purchases, transfers, or sales of unNFTs. To use our Service, you must use a third-party wallet which allows you to engage in transactions on blockchains.&#x20;

untrading.org is not party to any agreement between any users. You bear full responsibility for verifying the identity, legitimacy, and authenticity of unNFTs that you purchase from third-party sellers using the Service and we make no claims about the identity, legitimacy, functionality, or authenticity of users or NFTs (and any content associated with such unNFTs) visible on the Service.&#x20;

Because we have a growing number of services, we sometimes need to provide additional terms for specific services (and such services are deemed part of the “Service” hereunder and shall also be subject to these Terms). Those additional terms and conditions, which are available with the relevant service, then become part of your agreement with us if you use those services. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and any additional applicable terms we may provide for a specific service, such additional terms shall control for that specific service.&#x20;

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change or modify portions of these Terms at any time. If we do this, we will post the changes on this page and will indicate at the top of this page the date these Terms were last revised. We will also notify you, either through the Protocol user interface, in an email notification or through other reasonable means. Any such changes will become effective no earlier than fourteen (14) days after they are posted, except that changes addressing new functions of the Protocol will be effective immediately. Your continued use of the Protocol after the date any such changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service.&#x20;

## Privacy Policy&#x20;

Our Privacy Policy found [here](privacy-policy.md) describes the ways we collect, use, store and disclose your personal information, and is hereby incorporated by this reference into these Terms. You agree to the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of your data in accordance with our Privacy Policy.&#x20;

## <mark style="color:red;">01</mark>   What is untrading.org?&#x20;

untrading.org provides an Interface for Users, including artists and cryptocurrency traders (”Originators,” “Creators,” or “Minter”) and collectors (“Collectors”), to sell, purchase, list for auction, make offers on, and bid on (each a “Transaction”) Digital Artwork and other tokenized assets (as defined below).

\
The Interface is a web-based means of accessing the Protocol. The Interface is distinct from the Protocol. The Protocol comprises open-source or source-available self-executing smart contracts that are deployed on various public blockchains, such as Ethereum. untrading.org does not control or operate any version of the Protocol on any blockchain network. By using the Interface, you understand that you are not buying or selling digital assets from us and that we do not operate any liquidity pools on the Protocol or control trade execution on the Protocol. When traders pay fees for trades, those fees accrue to other users of the Protocol. As a general matter, untrading.org is not a liquidity provider into Protocol liquidity pools and liquidity providers are independent third parties.&#x20;

To access or use the Interface, you must be able to form a legally binding contract with us. Accordingly, you represent that you are at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction (e.g. 18 years old in the United States) and have the full right, power, and authority to enter into and comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement on behalf of yourself and any company or legal entity for which you may access or use the Interface.&#x20;

You further represent that you are not (a) the subject of economic or trade sanctions administered or enforced by any governmental authority or otherwise designated on any list of prohibited or restricted parties (including but not limited to the list maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury) or (b) a citizen, resident, or organized in a jurisdiction or territory that is the subject of comprehensive country-wide, territory-wide, or regional economic sanctions by the United States. Finally, you represent that your access and use of the Interface will fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and that you will not access or use the Interface to conduct, promote, or otherwise facilitate any illegal activity.&#x20;

### a) Smart-Contract Enabled&#x20;

“Digital Artwork and other tokenized assets” and other tokenized assets on the Protocol refers to a non-fungible Ethereum- and Polygon-based token that uses smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain (“Smart Contracts”). The Ethereum blockchain provides an immutable ledger of all transactions that occur on the blockchain. This means that all Digital Artwork and other tokenized assets or other tokenized assets are outside of the control of any one party, including untrading.org, and are subject to many risks and uncertainties. We neither own nor control MetaMask, Coinbase, the Ethereum network, the smart contracts on which Collections (as defined below) are based (“Collection Smart Contracts”), your browser, or any other third party site, product, or service that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to use the various features of the Protocol. We will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any such third parties, nor will we be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of your transactions or any other interaction with any such third parties. You understand that your Ethereum public address will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a Transaction on the Protocol.

### b) Noncustodial and No Fiduciary&#x20;

Duties The Interface is a purely non-custodial application, meaning you are solely responsible for the custody of the cryptographic private keys to the digital asset wallets you hold. This Agreement is not intended to, and does not, create or impose any fiduciary duties on us. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you acknowledge and agree that we owe no fiduciary duties or liabilities to you or any other party, and that to the extent any such duties or liabilities may exist at law or in equity, those duties and liabilities are hereby irrevocably disclaimed, waived, and eliminated. You further agree that the only duties and obligations that we owe you are those set out expressly in this Agreement.&#x20;

While untrading.org offers an Interface for Digital Artwork and other tokenized assets, it does not buy, sell, or ever take custody or possession of any Digital Artwork and other tokenized assets. The Protocol facilitates User collection of Digital Artwork and other tokenized assets, but neither untrading.org nor the Protocol are custodians of any Digital Artwork and other tokenized assets. The User understands and acknowledges that the Smart Contracts do not give untrading.org custody, possession, or control of any Digital Artwork and other tokenized assets or cryptocurrency at any time for the purpose of facilitating Transactions on the Protocol. You affirm that you are aware and acknowledge that untrading.org is a non-custodial service provider and has designed the Protocol to be directly accessible by the Users without any involvement or actions taken by untrading.org or any third-party. untrading.org facilitates Transactions between the Users on the Protocol but is not a party to any agreement between any sellers, buyers, Creators, Collectors, and other Users. As an Interface, untrading.org cannot make any representation or guarantee that Creators or Users will achieve any particular outcome as the result of listing their Digital Artwork and other tokenized assets or engaging in any other Transaction on the Protocol.&#x20;

### c) Not Registered with the SEC or Any Other Agency

We are not registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a national securities exchange or in any other capacity. You understand and acknowledge that we do not broker trading orders on your behalf nor do we collect or earn fees from your trades on the Protocol. We also do not facilitate the execution or settlement of your trades, which occur entirely on the public distributed blockchains like Ethereum. As a result, we do not (and cannot) guarantee market best pricing or best execution through the Interface or when using our Auto Routing feature, which routes trades across liquidity pools on the Protocol only. Any references in the Interface to “best price” do not constitute a representation or warranty about pricing available through the Interface, on the Protocol, or elsewhere.&#x20;

### d) Non-Solicitation; No Investment Advice

You agree and understand that: (a) all trades you submit through the Interface are considered unsolicited, which means that they are solely initiated by you; (b) you have not received any investment advice from us in connection with any trades; and (c) we do not conduct a suitability review of any trades you submit.&#x20;

We may provide information about tokens in the Interface sourced from third-party data partners through features such as our Token Explorer or Token Lists (which includes a untrading.org Default List). We may also mark certain tokens as “Verified” to indicate that certain data providers have reviewed the token per their own listing criteria. All such information provided by the Interface is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as investment advice or a recommendation that a particular token is a safe or sound investment. You should not take, or refrain from taking, any action based on any information contained in the Interface. By providing token information for your convenience, we do not make any investment recommendations to you or opine on the merits of any transaction or opportunity. You alone are responsible for determining whether any investment, investment strategy or related transaction is appropriate for you based on your personal investment objectives, financial circumstances, and risk tolerance.&#x20;

### e) Compliance and Tax Obligations

The Interface may not be available or appropriate for use in your jurisdiction. By accessing or using the Interface, you agree that you are solely and entirely responsible for compliance with all laws and regulations that may apply to you. Specifically, your use of the Interface or the Protocol may result in various tax consequences, such as income or capital gains tax, value-added tax, goods and services tax, or sales tax in certain jurisdictions. It is your responsibility to determine whether taxes apply to any transactions you initiate or receive and, if so, to report and/or remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority.&#x20;

Digital Artwork and other tokenized assets on the App that was minted on or by a third party platform or service (“Non-untrading.org Artwork”) and the intellectual property rights of the content underlying such Non-untrading.org Artwork (“Non-untrading.org Content”) may be subject to separate license or other terms granted in connection with the initial sale of such Non-untrading.org Artwork (“Non-untrading.org Artwork Terms”), in which case those Non-untrading.org Artwork Terms will govern in connection with such content and materials, provided that in the event of any conflict between the Non-untrading.org Artwork Terms and these Terms that are not specific to a Collector’s rights to use or otherwise exploit the Non-untrading.org Content, these Terms shall govern and control as between you and untrading.org. Subject to the foregoing, if you purchase any Non-untrading.org Artwork, you agree to comply with the Non-untrading.org Artwork Terms.&#x20;

### e) App Content, Software, and Trademarks&#x20;

untrading.org distributed the open source untrading.org App and distributes other software. While our code is in part available to download, review, and improve under open-source and source-available software licenses, none of our licenses include a license to use our trademarks. Proper use of our trademarks is essential to inform users whether or not untrading.org stands behind a product or service. When using untrading.org’ trademarks, you must comply with these untrading.org Trademark Guidelines. Just like other projects that develop open source software, we must enforce our trademark rights to protect our users.&#x20;

This policy covers all of our trademarks and services marks, whether they are registered or not, including, among others:

1. The trademarks and service marks: untrading.org™ (“untrading wordmarks”).

* You may not change the untrading.org logos except to scale them. If you use the untrading.org logos, give them adequate spacing from the other elements on the web page or document to ensure legibility and reduce the likelihood of confusion.&#x20;
* You must always use the wordmarks in their exact form and with the correct spelling, neither abbreviated, hyphenated, nor combined with any other word or words.&#x20;
* You must always use the untrading.org wordmarks only as an adjective, never as a noun or verb, or in plural or possessive forms.

**All other uses of a untrading.org trademark require our prior written permission.**&#x20;

Contact us at [legal@untrading.org](mailto:legal@untrading.org) for more information.&#x20;

#### Unacceptable Uses&#x20;

Some specific things you should not do include:&#x20;

* Don’t use our trademarks in anything dishonest or fraudulent.&#x20;
* Our name is not your name. Don’t use untrading.org trademarks in the name of your smart contract, interface, business, product, service, app, domain name, publication, or other offering.&#x20;
* Don’t use our name for your products. Don’t apply untrading.org trademarks to any product (e.g., a mobile app), unless such use is limited to a truthful and descriptive reference (e.g., “Mobile App for trading on untrading.org interface”).&#x20;

* Don’t imply our sponsorship of your products. Don’t use untrading.org trademarks in a way that incorrectly implies affiliation with, sponsorship, endorsement, or approval by untrading.org of your products or services. For example, please do not name your project compatible with untrading.org software Un-\[Something] or un-\[Something].&#x20;
* Don’t imply our sponsorship of your activities. Don’t use untrading.org trademarks, or confusingly similar trademarks on social media accounts in a way that might suggest affiliation with untrading.org or untrading.org software; except if you’ve received prior permission from untrading.org. For example, you cannot name your account, page, or community “untrading.org App” or “untrading.org Team.” However, it would be acceptable to name your account, page, or community “Fans of untrading.org” or “Information about untrading.org”.&#x20;
* Don’t create swag with our marks. Don’t use untrading.org trademarks on merchandise for sale (e.g., selling t-shirts, mugs, etc.) unless you have permission from untrading.org.&#x20;

#### Others’ Trademarks&#x20;

A note on others’ trademarks: untrading.org manages one interface (among many) for accessing the untrading.org App, which it does NOT control. Without the involvement of untrading.org, a third-party developer can use the Ethereum App to create a token that may implicate others’ trademarks or other rights and add that token to the untrading.org App. untrading.org cannot prevent or block any actions related to the untrading.org App, however, if untrading.org becomes aware of trademark misuse allegations, we will work with trademark owners to review the allegations and may remove content from the untrading.org interface.&#x20;

Creators, Collectors, and all Users expressly agree to cooperate and timely respond to untrading.org’s investigations, requests, and inquiries related to DMCA disputes or allegations of infringement.&#x20;

## <mark style="color:red;">05</mark>   What Fees Does untrading.org Charge?&#x20;

### a) Fees and Royalties&#x20;

You agree and understand that all royalties (“Originators’ Rewards,” “ORs”), Future Rewards (“FRs”) and other compensation (together, “Fees”) are in consideration of untrading.org's provision of the Protocol hereunder (including minting and/or listing unNFTs) and such Fees will be transferred, processed, or initiated directly through one or more of the smart contracts on the Ethereum or Polygon blockchain network.&#x20;

The Fees for an any sale on the App of Digital Artwork and other tokenized assets launched on the App (“Sale”) are set by the Originators for each trading asset, and are as  follows:&#x20;

* For the purchase of an unNFT or any tokenized asset, untrading.org does not charge any fees, commissions, or royalties.&#x20;
* In the chain of ownership, each trading asset creates a Flow that collects non-fungible future rewards (nFRs). Instead of calculating fees based on sales prices, the fees are entirely based on realized profit.
* Originators, or Creators, set the total Reward Ratio (f) of total realized profit (P) between 5% to 50%).&#x20;
* Originator Rewards (ORs) are set between 5% to 50% of the total Rewards.&#x20;
* Creators receive 70% of the total ORs from any profitable Sale.&#x20;
* untrading.org collects up to 30% of the total ORs from any profitable Sale (this rate is currently set to 0%). untrading.org may, in its sole discretion, consequently distribute its portion of the total sales price in its discretion.&#x20;
* Generations of buyers and former owners within the reward Window Size (w) specified by the Originator at the time of minting of the unNFT asset receive the remaining portion of the total Rewards (FR = R - OR).

### b) Users Agree to the Automated Collection and Disbursement of Fees by the Smart Contracts&#x20;

The User agrees and understands that all fees, commissions, and royalties are transferred, processed, or initiated directly through one or more of the Smart Contracts on the Ethereum blockchain network. By transacting on the platform and by using the Smart Contracts, the User hereby acknowledges, consents to, and accepts all automated fees, commissions, and royalties for the sale of Items on the untrading.org Protocol. The User hereby consents to and agrees to be bound by the Smart Contracts’ execution and distribution of the fees, commissions, and royalties.

Users hereby waive any entitlement to royalties, commissions, or fees paid to another by operation of the Smart Contracts.&#x20;

### c) Off-Market Transactions&#x20;

### e) Split&#x20;

Creators can share earnings from the sale of Digital Artwork and other tokenized assets launched on the Protocol. The terms and mechanics of how to split earnings are set forth here.&#x20;

### f) Gas&#x20;

All Transactions on the Protocol, including without limitation minting, tokenizing, bidding, listing, offering, purchasing, or confirming, are facilitated by smart contracts existing on the Ethereum network. The Ethereum network requires the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas fee”) for every transaction that occurs on the Ethereum network, and thus every Transaction occurring on the Protocol. The value of the Gas Fee changes, often unpredictably, and is entirely outside of the control of untrading.org. The User acknowledges that under no circumstances will a contract, agreement, offer, sale, bid, or other Transaction on the Protocol be invalidated, revocable, retractable, or otherwise unenforceable on the basis that the Gas Fee for the given transaction was unknown, too high, or otherwise unacceptable.&#x20;

### g) Taxes&#x20;

Users are responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties, and assessments now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority, “associated with your use of the Protocol (including, without limitation, any taxes that may become payable as the result of your ownership, transfer, purchase, sale, or creation of any artworks).&#x20;

### e) User Acknowledges Financial Risk of Digital Assets&#x20;

You accept all consequences of using the Protocol, including the risk that you may lose access to your digital assets indefinitely. All transaction decisions are made solely by you. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, we accept no responsibility whatsoever for and will in no circumstances be liable to you in connection with the use of the Protocol for performing digital asset transactions. Under no circumstances will the operation of all or any portion of the Protocol be deemed to create a relationship that includes the provision or tendering of investment advice.&#x20;

**Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration: PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.**&#x20;

### a) Agreement to Arbitrate

This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in these Terms as the “Arbitration Agreement.” You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and untrading.org, whether arising out of or relating to these Terms (including any alleged breach thereof), the Apps, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and untrading.org are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.&#x20;

**Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief YOU AND untrading.org AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND untrading.org AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.**&#x20;

### b) Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution&#x20;

untrading.org is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer’s satisfaction by emailing customer support at support@untrading.org.app. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to untrading.org should be sent to 11420 Santa Monica Blvd, PO Box 252111, Los Angeles, CA 90025 (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If untrading.org and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or untrading.org may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by untrading.org or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or untrading.org is entitled.&#x20;

### c) Arbitration Procedures

Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page, http://www.adr.org/ as may be updated from time to time. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under these Terms and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. Unless untrading.org and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, untrading.org agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.&#x20;

### d) Costs of Arbitration&#x20;

Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, untrading.org will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, untrading.org will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, untrading.org will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.&#x20;

### e) Confidentiality&#x20;

All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.&#x20;

### f) Severability&#x20;

If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of these Terms will continue to apply.&#x20;

### g) Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement&#x20;

Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, untrading.org agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a User of the App, you may reject any such change by sending untrading.org written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).
