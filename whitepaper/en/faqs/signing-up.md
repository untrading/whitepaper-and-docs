<summary>Why must I be verified via Twitter on app.untrading.org?</summary>

By requiring users to verify their identity and link their accounts to a Twitter account, the protocol can ensure that it is doing its best to prevent wash trading. It may also help to protect users by ensuring that only legitimate accounts can access the service.

Wash trading is a type of market manipulation in which a trader buys and sells a security for the purpose of creating the appearance of activity in the market. This can be done by a single trader or by a group of traders working together. The goal of wash trading is often to manipulate the price of a security or to create the impression of a particular trend in the market, such as an upward trend. By squatting ownership rights, wash traders can gain unfair financial rewards under [EIP-5173](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5173), which harms the entire Flow ecosystem.

There are several ways to prevent wash trading:

1. Implementing strict trade monitoring: By monitoring trades and identifying patterns that may indicate wash trading, untrading.org can prevent this type of market manipulation.
2. Establishing rules and regulations: untrading.org establishes rules and regulations that prohibit wash trading and establish penalties for users who engage in this type of activity. Please see our [Community Guidelines](../community-guidelines.md) for and [Terms of Service](../terms-of-service.md) for more information.&#x20;
3. Utilizing surveillance technology: Advanced surveillance technology can help exchanges identify and prevent wash trading by analyzing trade data and detecting unusual patterns or anomalies.
4. Enforcing strict penalties: By imposing strict penalties on users who engage in wash trading, untrading.org can discourage this type of behavior and create a more fair and transparent market.
5. Publish transparent reporting: untrading.org will publish regular transaction activity findings and provide transparent reporting in order to prevent wash trading.

Later, additional verification methods and OAuth sign-ins will be added.
