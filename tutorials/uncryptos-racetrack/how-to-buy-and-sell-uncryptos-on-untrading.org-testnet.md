# How to Buy and Sell unCryptos on untrading.org Testnet

untrading is a revolutionary platform that allows you to invest in cryptocurrencies with enhanced profitability, transparency and ownership history. By using the innovative Decentralized Strategy As A Platform (dSaaP) created by ERC-5173, you can participate in the future value increase of your tokens even after you sell them. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the testnet version of untrading to get familiar with its features and functionalities.

**Are you ready to rewrite the rules of investing?** With untrading and its revolutionary unCryptos, you can! unCryptos are living, breathing investments that keep rewarding you long after you sell. These dynamic investment vehicles are defined by four key parameters: **Total Rewards (R), Originator's Rewards (ORs), Future Rewards (FRs)**, and N**umber of Participating Generations (# of Gens)**. These parameters dictate your share of future profits, the Originator's cut, and the token's lineage. Dive into the testnet with this tutorial and unlock the secrets of personalized wealth creation with unCryptos!

Ready to take control of your crypto future? Let's begin!

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you will need the following:

* A web browser that supports Web3, such as Chrome, Firefox, or Brave.
* A MetaMask wallet extension installed on your browser and connected to the Ethereum testnet (Sepolia), as well as the Polygon testnet (Amoy). (You need to enable Ethereum test networks on MetaMask's "Select a network" popup and tick the "Show test networks" option. To add Polygon Amoy to your wallet, please follow this page: [https://polygon.technology/blog/introducing-the-amoy-testnet-for-polygon-pos](https://polygon.technology/blog/introducing-the-amoy-testnet-for-polygon-pos).)
* Some test ETH and test MATIC in your MetaMask wallet.&#x20;
* A basic understanding of cryptocurrency trading concepts, such as tokens, swaps, and wrapping.

## Step 1: Acquire Test Tokens

To use untrading, you will need some test tokens that represent different cryptocurrencies. You can directly mint test tokens on our Sepolia chain. On other testnets, you can swap your test ETH (or test MATIC) for test WBTC, test WETH, test USDT, and test USDC on the [https://testnet.untrading.org/](https://testnet.untrading.org/) testnet.

### Testnet Native Tokens:

* **Ethereum testnet native test tokens:** You can get test ETH for free from a faucet (we recommend a Sepolia faucet):  [https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de/](https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de/), [https://sepoliafaucet.com/](https://sepoliafaucet.com/), or [https://www.infura.io/faucet/sepolia](https://www.infura.io/faucet/sepolia).

Once you have some test USDC and USDT tokens, you can buy unBTC and unETH on [https://testnet.untrading.org/uncryptos](https://testnet.untrading.org/uncryptos).&#x20;

* To buy an existing offering, go to [https://testnet.untrading.org/uncryptos](https://testnet.untrading.org/uncryptos), or click on the “Markets" tab on any other page you are on.&#x20;

## Step 3: Wrap unBTC, unETH, unSOL, unLINK, unUNI, and UN²&#x20;

untrading uses its own tokens, called unBTC, unETH, unSOL, unLINK, unUNI, and UN², to enable the dSaaP features. These tokens are wrapped versions of WBTC, WETH, SOL, LINK, UNI and UN respectively, which are ERC-20 tokens that represent Bitcoin and Ether on the Ethereum network. To wrap your unBTC, unETH, unSOL, unLINK, unUNI, and UN² into unBTC/USDT and unETH/USDC, for example, follow these steps:

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have learned how to use the testnet version of untrading, a commission-free crypto investment protocol that enables token owners to benefit from future price increases even after selling their tokens. Once you’ve bought your unBTC and unETH, please immediately list them for sale so other users can buy your tokens. The real magic happens after you have sold them as you can now watch your Future Rewards grow. This is the fundamental difference between untrading and any other platforms.

You can now explore the platform and experiment with different trading strategies. Remember, this is a testnet version, so the tokens you use have no real value and the platform may not be fully functional or stable.&#x20;

You have learned how to:

* Acquire test tokens;
* Wrap and unwrap unBTC, unETH, unSOL, unLINK, unUNI, and UN² from test WBTC and test WETH, test SOL, test LINK, test UNI and test UN tokens;
* Buy and sell unToken offerings on the uncryptos marketplace.
