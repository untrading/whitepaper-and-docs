# What is Web3?

Web3 is an umbrella term for the vision of a better internet; an internet with an added identity, money, and social layer. An internet built upon open protocols that value transparency and innovation.

Web3 takes away the need for intermediaries or third parties and gives you direct ownership over your digital identity and assets in a way like never before. It is the shift from an internet of information, to an internet of value.

Let’s face it, we all love the internet. It keeps us connected with people from all over the world, enables us to learn almost anything in an efficient way, and has a never ending supply of funny cat videos. No really, we don’t want any of that to go away. We do think that the relationship between platform and user must change to serve us better. To serve you better.

And that’s what this is about. We’re in the early stages of web3 where programmable networks like Ethereum allow innovation and creativity to rapidly sprout.
