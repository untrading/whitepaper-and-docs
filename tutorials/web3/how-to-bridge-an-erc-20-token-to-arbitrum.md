Bridging tokens to Arbitrum allows you to take advantage of lower fees and faster transactions on this Layer 2 scaling solution. Follow these steps to bridge your ERC-20 tokens from Ethereum mainnet to Arbitrum:

1. **Connect your wallet**
   * Use a compatible wallet like MetaMask
   * Ensure you have ETH for gas fees on both networks
2. **Choose a bridge**
   * Popular options include the Arbitrum Bridge or third-party bridges like Hop or Across
   * For this tutorial, we'll use the official Arbitrum Bridge ([bridge.arbitrum.io](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/))
3. **Select token and amount**
   * Choose the ERC-20 token you want to bridge
   * Enter the amount you wish to transfer
4. **Approve the token**
   * If it's your first time bridging this token, you'll need to approve it
   * This requires a separate transaction
5. **Initiate the bridge**
   * Confirm the transaction in your wallet
   * Pay the Ethereum gas fee
6. **Wait for confirmation**
   * The bridging process typically takes about 10 minutes
   * You can track the status on Arbiscan
7. **Add Arbitrum network to your wallet**
   * If you haven't already, add Arbitrum to your wallet
   * You can find network details on Arbitrum's website
8. **Add the token to your Arbitrum wallet**
   * Import the token address on Arbitrum
   * You should now see your bridged tokens

By following these steps, you can efficiently bridge your ERC-20 tokens to the Arbitrum network and begin exploring its ecosystem.

Remember to always double-check addresses and amounts before confirming transactions. Happy bridging!
