# Untrading: Equitable Growth

Untrading enables your money to work together with everyone else’s to grow bigger—without the zero-sum burn.

***

### 1. What Is Untrading?

Most financial modalities are unfair: when one person wins, someone else loses.

Untrading changes the game—it’s built so everyone wins together.

We use something called the ARC Protocol (short for Appreciation & Return Conduit). Think of it as the central engine that enables your savings to grow and share fairly.

***

### 2. How It Works

There are two key roles within ARC:

* Growth Players:
* They “sow” digital trees 🌳 that contain assets (like Bitcoin) that grow over time.
* Sell the matured tree after the first “harvest” (predetermined sale price) and keep the profits!
* Get a magic slip 📜 that sends extra profit from that very tree as it grows – even after selling it!
* Use the sale money to buy another tree, growing an endless orchard of rewards. It's like owning one tree but getting free fruit from a whole farm you helped start! 🌳🌳🌳
* Income Players:
* They fuel the trees with water 💧 (stablecoins) to help the trees grow.&#x20;
* When trees bloom, the Income players get rewarded for their work. 🌟

Together, they harmoniously strengthen the ARC as time passes, allowing for sustained growth over future cycles and seasons.

### 3. The Secret Is Time

Untrading is special because it uses time itself to share rewards:

* Magic Slip (Backwards Sharing):\
  When someone sells, they still earn when the tree’s next owner makes more money later. Past helpers get rewarded!
* Rainy Day Reserve (Forwards Sharing):\
  When the market slows, we tap into our reserve, or what we call the Prosperity Reserve to share extra fruits with long-time users. It keeps everyone happy even in slow times.

### 4. Why It’s Different

* 🌈 Win-Win: Everyone helps each other grow.
* ⚙️ No Fees: Nothing is taken from your fruits.
* 🔍 Clear Goals: You know exactly when and how you’ll earn.

⏱ Time Power: Rewards travel through time—backward and forward!
