Ready to take control of your crypto future? Let's begin!

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you will need the following:

* A web browser that supports Web3, such as Chrome, Firefox, or Brave.
* A MetaMask wallet extension installed on your browser and connected to the Ethereum testnet (Sepolia), as well as the Polygon testnet (Amoy). (You need to enable Ethereum test networks on MetaMask's "Select a network" popup and tick the "Show test networks" option. To add Polygon Amoy to your wallet, please follow this page: [https://polygon.technology/blog/introducing-the-amoy-testnet-for-polygon-pos](https://polygon.technology/blog/introducing-the-amoy-testnet-for-polygon-pos).)
* Some test ETH and test MATIC in your MetaMask wallet.&#x20;
* A basic understanding of cryptocurrency trading concepts, such as tokens, swaps, and wrapping.

## Step 1: Acquire Test Tokens

To use untrading, you will need some test tokens that represent different cryptocurrencies. You can directly mint test tokens on our Sepolia chain. On other testnets, you can swap your test ETH (or test MATIC) for test WBTC, test WETH, test USDT, and test USDC on the [https://testnet.untrading.org/](https://testnet.untrading.org/) testnet.

### Testnet Native Tokens:

* **Ethereum testnet native test tokens:** You can get test ETH for free from a faucet (we recommend a Sepolia faucet):  [https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de/](https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de/), [https://sepoliafaucet.com/](https://sepoliafaucet.com/), or [https://www.infura.io/faucet/sepolia](https://www.infura.io/faucet/sepolia).

## Step 3: Wrap unBTC, unETH, unSOL, unLINK, unUNI, and UN²&#x20;

untrading uses its own tokens, called unBTC, unETH, unSOL, unLINK, unUNI, and UN², to enable the dSaaP features. These tokens are wrapped versions of WBTC, WETH, SOL, LINK, UNI and UN respectively, which are ERC-20 tokens that represent Bitcoin and Ether on the Ethereum network. To wrap your unBTC, unETH, unSOL, unLINK, unUNI, and UN² into unBTC/USDT and unETH/USDC, for example, follow these steps:

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have learned how to use the testnet version of untrading, a commission-free crypto investment protocol that enables token owners to benefit from future price increases even after selling their tokens. Once you’ve bought your unBTC and unETH, please immediately list them for sale so other users can buy your tokens. The real magic happens after you have sold them as you can now watch your Future Rewards grow. This is the fundamental difference between untrading and any other platforms.

You can now explore the platform and experiment with different trading strategies. Remember, this is a testnet version, so the tokens you use have no real value and the platform may not be fully functional or stable.&#x20;

You have learned how to:

* Acquire test tokens;
* Wrap and unwrap unBTC, unETH, unSOL, unLINK, unUNI, and UN² from test WBTC and test WETH, test SOL, test LINK, test UNI and test UN tokens;
